            console.log("this.server")     //to check r they accessible

            //problem:- In react, When create mthd & click on mthd --> & wi8 onclick prop on button but still code not run. So, use bind
            //bind keyword ask to attach (not just manually)
    }      
    //as pg load obj of react(R key) get created
    const app = new React()   //As new create, const give reference to buttons
