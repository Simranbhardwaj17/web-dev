//Js behavior- prototype behavior(for inst)
//Js Mechanism -Why, how Js func

//In Browser console

const newH = ['sb', 'cc']
newH     // (after click on it u will see prototype)

// Js behavior: prototypal behavior(Js go above on above the layer(parent access GP) to find value until get null)
// By linking to this behav this keyword works. In arrow func this keyword not coz of proto there
// coz of prototype get access to new keyword, class, this keyw, prototypal inheritance

// Its behavior if not know ask someone(haar nhi manna cont. to find(layer by layer))
