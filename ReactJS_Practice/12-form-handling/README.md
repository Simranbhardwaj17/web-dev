# 📝 Key Concepts Used
✔ 1. Handling Form Submission

React uses the onSubmit event to capture form submission.

✔ 2. e.preventDefault()

Prevents the browser’s default behavior of refreshing the page after form submit.

✔ 3. Controlled Submission

The form calls a custom function submitHandler when submitted.

# ⚙️ How It Works

User types something in the input.

User clicks Submit.

submitHandler runs.

Page does not refresh.
